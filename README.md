## Introduction
This project aims to demonstrate my understanding of python, implement CI development practices and knowlegde fo cloud fundamentals.

## Design
There are four services to the project: \
1. ### Service 1 ###
Responsible for rendering a Jinja2 template for users to interact with the application. Users will be able to see realtime data of trades executed.
2. ### Service 2 ###
Connecting to an external API, recieving live trade data from the Binance exchange. The first implementation will focus on one currency pair: **BTC/USDT**.
  1. Future revisions can allow for retrevial of other currency pairs.
3. ### Service 3 ###
Contain a database of names and balances of traders and choose two random names from the database, representing the buyer and seller. Each trader will have an initial balance of **1 BTC** and **10000 USDT**.
4. ### Service 4 ###
Asign the random names generated by service 3 to the trade recieved from service 1, and update the balances according to the trader data.
 1. A future revision can update the balances stored in the database for each trader.



## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|--------------------|
| Broken vesion gets deployed | High | Use a version control system such as github |
|Cross site request forgery | Low | Set a secret key |
